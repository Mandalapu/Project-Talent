In the top row, the figure at the right is the same as the one to the left of it except that it has been turned upside down. Following these rules, the missing figure should be larger than the one above it, and exactly the same size as the one to the left of it, but upside down. Therefore, the response choice selected is the correct answer.\n\n

    <string name="practiceq1">Here is a practice item.  Select the figure that completes the pattern then press NEXT.  Or if you would like to read the instructions again, press the BACK button.</string>
    <string name="practiceq2">Now look at another problem, which is quite different from either of the previous ones.</string>
    <string name="pr_right">That is correct. Going from left to right, the circles get larger, and going from top to bottom they get darker.</string>
    <string name="pr_wrong">No, the correct response is this one.  Going from left to right, the circles get larger, and going from top to bottom they get darker. Therefore the answer has to be a circle which is the largest of the three sizes, and the darkest. There are two response options that are the right size, but only one has the correct shading. The selected response is the only drawing that fits the pattern.\n\n
        Press the NEXT button to continue, or the BACK button to go back one page.
	</string>
    <string name="pr_explain">What is the missing figure here? If you study the pattern you will see that going from left to right there is one more line in each figure than in the one to the left of it. Going from top to bottom, the number of lines in any figure is one less than in the figure just above it. Therefore, the missing figure should have three lines. The correct answer has been selected (the three lines, slanting in the proper direction).</string>
    <string name="ar_intro">INSTRUCTIONS\n\n
		•	You will now be asked six more questions like the ones you just did. \n 
		•	For each problem, decide what rules the pattern follows. Choose the answer that belongs in the question mark (?) by pressing the response option.\n
		•	Each problem has a different rule, so the patterns may seem quite different from the ones in the example items. \n
		•	Do not spend too much time on any one problem. \n\n
